## Examples.

## shell\_log - run a shell and log all output to a file.

This utility has the same basic functionality as the standard
unix script(1) utility.

It spawns a shell, using a pseudo-terminal, relays all the i/o
between the pty and the local tty, and also logs all output
of the shell and any commands it runs to a file.
